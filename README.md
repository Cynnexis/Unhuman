Unhuman is my personal project to learn TensorFlow.

## Getting Started ##
### Tree View ###
The `res/` folder contains the datasets of the projects (fetch by `tf.keras.get_file()` method) and also other resources.
`src/` contains the python source file for this project. Under `src/unhuman/`, you will find the following packages:
* **`tutorials/`:** All the python files related to the tutorials I have found on [the official TensorFlow website](https://www.tensorflow.org/).
* **`utils/`:** Classes that are useful for the tutorial. For instance, the class `Stopwatch` measure the time elapsed between a specific algorithm.
* **`curiosity/`:** My personal package where I test what I learn by myself.

## Built with ##
The library that I used for that project are:
* [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) - The Google's API to generate quickly a neural network, or other model related to the machine learning field.
* [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) - Python library which plots data

Also used the following tools:
* [JetBrains PyCharm Community](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) - Python IDE
* [Bue-ish](https://github.com/Cynnexis/Blue-ish) - My python script which generate project name (it generated the name *Unhuman*)
